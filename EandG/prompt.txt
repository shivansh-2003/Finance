k here i wan to make personal fianace  Expense Tracking and Categorization Goal Setting and Progress Tracking: whcih should be powered by llm . ok i will explain the work flow step by step : 1. fiest there will be  chat bot  where you can  enter     Users can input transactions in natural language, e.g., “I spent $50 on groceries yesterday.” this chat bot(llm:- gpt 4 turbo) will extrect  key details like amount, category, and date. Store transaction data in a database (e.g., SQLite, Firebase) with fields for amount, category, date, and description.  2.      Generate Monthly Summaries:
    •    Use the stored data to calculate total spending per category.
    •    Generate summaries using generative AI in a conversational format:
    •    Example: “You spent $500 on dining last month, which is 20% higher than your usual budget.”
    •    Visualize trends using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly for graphs.                     3. Goal Setting and Progress Tracking
    i)    Goal Input via Chat:
    •    Users can set goals in natural language, e.g., “I want to save $1,000 for a vacation by June.”
    •    Parse inputs using NLP to extract goal details:
    •    Target amount ($1,000)
    •    Purpose (vacation)
    •    Deadline (June).
    ii).    Track Progress:
    •    Compare current savings (calculated from income minus expenses) with the target amount.
    •    Update users on progress periodically:
    •    Example: “You’ve saved $400 so far. You need $600 more to reach your goal by June.”
    iii).    Generate Suggestions:
    •    Use generative AI to suggest adjustments based on spending patterns:
    •    Example: “Reduce dining expenses by $50 per week to meet your savings goal faster.”
    •    Provide alternative strategies like increasing income or reallocating budgets.
    iv).    Reminders and Alerts:
    •    Set automated reminders for users about their goals.
    •    Example: “Reminder: You’re halfway through your savings goal for your vacation!”
    v).    Visualization of Progress:
    •    Create progress bars or charts showing how close users are to their goals.
    •    Example: A bar graph with milestones marked at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. OK the tech stack i will prefer list down in order :-                                              
     1.) supabase for database  ,   2.)for like extrecting details form chat of  amount, category, and date and goal setting like “I want to save $1,000 for a vacation by June.” use cost effective model like gpt -_4- miini but                        
     
     3.) like to give tailor feedback , or geenrating monthly summaries or Generate Suggestions: on spending patterns:  use more complex models like claude sonet 3.5      
     4.) for visualization use only plotly   Remember please create me a streamlit interface for. ui that considiering that make an idividual file fir easch functionalliyu for the purpose of esay debugging and testing and call the fucntion for different file in a final streamlit app  named app.py        ok once again i will tell you example of my workflow :-                                                                                                           Example Workflow
Expense Tracking:
    1.    User input via chat: “I spent $30 on coffee today.”
    2.    NLP extracts details: Amount: $30
Category: Dining
Date: Today
    3.    The system stores the transaction and updates the monthly summary.
    4.    Generative AI generates a summary:“You’ve spent $150 on dining this month, which is 10% below your usual budget.” Goal Setting:
    1.    User input via chat: “I want to save $5000 for a car by December.”
    2.    NLP extracts details: Target Amount: $5000
Purpose: Car
Deadline: December
3.    The system tracks savings progress based on income/expenses.
    4.    Generative AI suggests adjustments:“Cut back on entertainment spending by $100/month to meet your goal faster.”
This approach ensures an engaging user experience while leveraging the power of generative AI and AI agents effectively!   ok once agin you tech stack in supabase , open api key , anthropic api key , langchain  , streamlit and other whcih you feel necessary
